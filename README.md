# VS2017Cleanup
Cleanup Visual Studio 2017 Layout folder from outdated packages.

Run the script inside Visual Studio 2017 layout folder.

It will scan Catalog.json and build a list of folders which are no longer needed by the setup.
If run with `--delete` argument it will automatically delete these folders.

Keep your Visual Studio Installer slim ;)
